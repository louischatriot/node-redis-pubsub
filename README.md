NRP (Node Redis Pubsub)
=================

Simple pubsub for node using Redis. Why use NRP instead of Node's EventEmitter? It is useful when
your Node application needs to share data with other applications. In that case EventEmitter will not
help you, you need an external pubsub provider. Redis is pretty good at this, but its pubsub API
is strange. So you use this wrapper.

## Install and test
```bash
$ npm install node-redis-pubsub      # Install locally
$ npm install -g node-redis-pubsub   # Install globally
$ 
$ make test   # test (devDependencies need to be installed and a Redis server up)
```

## Usage
### Setup
for a trusted environment where Redis runs locally, unprotected on a port blocked by firewall.

```javascript
var NRP = require('node-redis-pubsub')
  , config = { port: 6379       // Port of your locally running Redis server
             , scope: 'demo'    // Use a scope to prevent two NRPs from sharing messages
             }
  , nrp = new NRP(config);      // This is the NRP client
```

for a remote Redis server

```javascript
var NRP = require('node-redis-pubsub')
  , config = { port: 1234       // Port of your remote Redis server
             , host: 'path.to.reremote.redis.host' // Redis server host, defaults to 127.0.0.1
             , auth: 'password' // Password 
             , scope: 'demo'    // Use a scope to prevent two NRPs from sharing messages
             }
  , nrp = new NRP(config);      // This is the NRP client
```

### Simple pubsub

```javascript
nrp.on('say hello', function (data) {
  console.log('Hello ' + data.name);
});

nrp.emit('say hello', { name: 'Louis' });   // Outputs 'Hello Louis'


// You can use patterns to capture all messages of a certain type
nrp.on('city:*', function (data) {
  console.log(data.city + ' is great');
});

nrp.emit('city:hello', { city: 'Paris' });   // Outputs 'Paris is great'
nrp.emit('city:yeah', { city: 'San Francisco' });   // Outputs 'San Francisco is great'
```
